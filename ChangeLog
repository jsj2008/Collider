08.08.2013 - Tom and Alan
        * Randomized ordering of W and Z events for WZ game 3

08.08.2013 - Tom
	* Checkin version 1.0.4
	* Briefing/Overview Document added

01.08.2013 - Tom
	* Final checkin
	* Everything is here, and the 'downloadable events' functionality is partially implemented and documented

10.07.2013 - Tom
	* Live Event streaming infrastructure in place
	* Theoretically it should work...
	* I can't test it until the updated skim script is running at CERN though...

10.07.2013 - Tom
	* Event scanning games created, 3 difficulty levels
	* z0 cut applied to tracks
	* UI tweaks
	* Removed a lot of fluff
	* About to add the streaming events...

01.07.2013 - Tom
	* Oops, Not checked in for a while.
	* Lots of stuff!

05.06.2013 - Tom
	* Now we're talking!
	* We have MOAR GAME LOGIC!
	* Buttons now 'select' events until 'check events' is clicked
	* Games are selectable from a new 'game selection screen'
	* Each game has a list of events which either show selected events, or marked events
	* The buttons should be a bit nicer, but need to play with more resolutions...

30.05.2013 - Tom
	* Adding in a saved game feature
		* Tracks progress through the games
		* Tutorial at the moment resets each time
	* Start of a download feature...
	* Much of the stuff isn't ready...

	* Game Logic! Finally the game buttons do something. Ugly at the moment, but can be tweaked.

19.05.2013 - Tom
	* Not much to see here, just making sure everything is checked in.

17.05.2013 - Tom
	* Added a 'game info' page to the landing screen - allows the user to read about the game then launch it
	* Landing screen populated by an easy to write xml format - need to test web based, but it looks promising!
	* A few bug fixes
		* The animation now stops when it reaches the end of the detector
		* Track calculation has a failure state - avoids infinite recursion
	* Added a 'tutorial' section

14.05.2013 - Tom
	* Tuning some objects to make event scanning a little simpler
	* Make calo towers a bit larger - perhaps some more sophisticated scaling here? Need to make large deposits obviously different from small ones
	* Track transparency based on pT, higher pT = more visible
	* MET arrow scaling length as well as width

13.05.2013 - Tom
	* pT cut on tracks - somewhere between 0.5 and 2 GeV might work?
	* Event skimming script bins more finely in calo
		* App code now reflects this
	* Previous and Next event prototype buttons present (and working)
	* Everything lines up! Hooray!

13.05.2013 - Tom
	* Fixed coordinate system mismatch
	* ATLAS x,y,z corresponds to OpenGL -y,z,x
	* HTTP streaming is working but an 'event manager' needs more work
	* Event skimming script updated to use polar angle theta for calo binning

08.05.2013 - Tom
	* Prototype landing screen
	* Allows loading the event display with different (preset for now) events
	* Hopefully this should be simple enough to modify for event streaming

30.04.2013 - Tom
	* In Event Display menu
	* Allows colour changes, hiding endcaps or all detectors and event animation

22.04.2013 - Tom
	* Initial Checkin
