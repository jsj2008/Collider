<other>I really liked the app and I thought the app did a good job of expla=
ining to me in a simple way the inner workings of the LHC. However, there i=
s one thing I was disappointed on because of the lack of interaction in two=
 sections. I do not understand the reason for including a great section to =
guess the event, but exclude this option in the 2d and 3d streaming section=
s. I was happy with the app, but I got to the 2d and 3d and wanted to guess=
 the event and could not. Please add!!! </other>
