<other>It would be nice to have more data on each event. Time and date at t=
he very least, but more specifics on the actual event would be better. Supe=
rb app, and one I plan to check often. I showed this to a PhD I work with w=
ho is actively producing silicone devices down to the 6-12nm range and impr=
essed the heck out of him! Now that was an accomplishment. Thank you! Keep =
up the excellent work and get people excited about the LUV.</other>
