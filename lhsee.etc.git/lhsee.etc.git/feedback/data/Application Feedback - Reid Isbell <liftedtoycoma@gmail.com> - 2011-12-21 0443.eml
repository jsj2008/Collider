<other>Wonderful app. I wish it was stereoscopic 3d though as I own the HTC=
 EVO 3d. One other notable feature is streaming live collisions. I currentl=
y have to manually download each collision, if the app would automatically =
download and truly stream the events live, that would be epic, given a paus=
e live events feature. Keep up the great work!</other>
