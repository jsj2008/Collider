<other>This app is great. However I remember a program called LHC@home and =
I was wondering if some kind of app could be written which makes use of the=
 millions of smartphones in the world today which could assist the LHC team=
 with their work. As it would also encourage public interest and participat=
ion and ultimately future engagement with the LHC and physics in general.
My email is m.k.bowler@hotmail.co.uk<mailto:m.k.bowler@hotmail.co.uk> if yo=

Thanks once again for the app.</other>
