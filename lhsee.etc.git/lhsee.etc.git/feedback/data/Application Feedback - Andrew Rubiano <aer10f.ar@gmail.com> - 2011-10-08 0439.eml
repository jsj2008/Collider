<other>this app is amazing. im one of those science nerds but actually isnt=
 studying physics in college. im a computer science major but physics fasci=
nates me because its like real magic. props to the developers of the app an=
d of course to everyone at cern. i just wish this app had a bit more to it.=
 was hoping streaming 3d u would show the collision animation in slow motio=
n so users can see the particles break apart and explode. but GREAT APP. ap=
ps like these make science fun and enjoyable with out having to understand =
all the math beneath it. so u dont have to be a physicist to understand it!=
 love it!</other>
