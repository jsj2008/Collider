<other>This was quite well designed and was actually extremely entertaining=
. It only took me a few tries to be able to discern the types of events des=
cribed. I'd love to have a live feed of events that I could guess at what t=
hey were. Perhaps a program could be written to supplement the so called "t=
racker" program to help use data from our smartphone guesses to help coales=
ce the data into more likely interesting event candidates? Just a thought. =
