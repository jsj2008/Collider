This code works with Marmalade `v8.5.0`.
It also uses the AppEasy asset (https://assetstore.madewithmarmalade.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=166). Previously this was called IwGame. You don't need to download AppEasy as this is already in this repository (but with some bugs fixed, so do not replace it!). The AppEasy website is down, the only thing I have is a back-up of the IwGame web-site (see repository).
